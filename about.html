   <p>Exam Cell Automation is a project with vision and the mission to automate exam
    cells in colleges. The purpose of developing Exam Cell Automation is to generate 
    question papers in a computerized way.
</p><p>
Admin can be the controller of examinations. You can see who is involved with the 
project by using admin. You can also see all the new people who have joined on your 
log-in page and work with them by using admin status. Staff members can be 
added/removed/modified by use of their respective admins It's important to know 
who is involved with your project in order to ensure you're always up-to-date. 
</p><p>
Faculty are vital employees in our institution, who can add and remove students 
from the system. This is a faculty page for an institution that allows faculty to
 generate examination papers. Faculty can add and remove questions from the question 
 bank, which will be randomly selected for students to answer. Faculty can choose to
  allocate time for examination, course code, course name, and the number of questions
   to display in the question paper.
</p><p>
Students who have received a credential from the admin can login to the system. 
The Student page is a convenient way to view grades, credits, and other info. 
 Students will have access to their data and can view the question banks provided
  by faculty. Students will be able to compare the questions to other students'tests,
   and then proceed with understanding how they should answer that particular question.
